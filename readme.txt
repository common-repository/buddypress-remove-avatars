=== Remove Avatars ===
Contributors: Peter Anselmo
Tags: wpmu, buddypress, plugin, remove, avatar, icon, picture
Requires at least: WPMU 2.8, BuddyPress 1.0
Tested up to: 2.9/1.2
Stable tag: 0.2.2

This plugin will remove all avatars (and optionally, all icons) from a Buddypress site

== Description ==

Note: You must have BuddyPress installed to use this plugin

This plugin will completely remove ALL avatars (including default, uploaded, or gravatar) from displaying on your BuddyPress site. This includes hiding the step for choosing avatars when creating groups or user accounts, and removing the menu items for editing avatars. This gives a more consistent (avatar-free) user experience than simply turning off the display with CSS alone. There is also the option to remove the icons in the user menus and activity filters.

Please let me know if you find any bugs, or if there are tweaks needed.  I will respond promptly.  peter@studio66design.com
 
== Installation ==

Make sure WPMU and BuddyPress are installed and active.

Copy the plugin folder buddypress-remove-avatars/ into /wp-content/plugins/

Browse to the plugin administration screen and activate the plugin.

Please don't hesitate to contact me, especially if you run into trouble.  I will respond promptly.  peter@studio66design.com
